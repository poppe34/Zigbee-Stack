 * \brief This file controls the software FIFO management.
 *
 * These functions manages FIFOs thanks to simple a API. The FIFO can
 * be 100% full thanks to a double-index range implementation. For example,
 * a FIFO of 4 elements can be implemented: the FIFO can really hold up to 4
 * elements.
 * This is particurly well suited for any kind of application needing a lot of 
 * small FIFO.
 *
 * - Compiler:           IAR EWAVR32 and GNU GCC for AVR32
 * - Supported devices:  All AVR32 devices can be used.
 * - AppNote:
